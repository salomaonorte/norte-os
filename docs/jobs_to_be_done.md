# For Norte Team

## Job 1: Proactive Portfolio Health Management
**When** I'm planning my week,  
**I want** to automatically see which companies need attention based on real-time metrics and anomalies,  
**So that** I can be proactive instead of reactive and catch problems before they become critical.

### Success Criteria:
- Dashboard showing portfolio-wide health scores
- Automated alerts for red flags (churn spike, revenue drop, team departures, <1.5 SD growth)
- Celebration alerts for green flags (>1.5 SD growth, key milestones)
- Predicted intervention needs (runway concerns, fundraising windows)

## Job 2: Intelligent Network Matching
**When** a founder has a specific need (customer, hire, investor),  
**I want** to instantly see relevant connections across Norte's network with context and warm intro paths,  
**So that** I can make high-quality introductions at scale without manually searching my memory/contacts.

### Success Criteria:
- Searchable directory of Norte's network (LPs, founders, friends, portfolio companies)
- AI-powered matching based on founder needs + network capabilities
- One-click intro generation with context
- Tracking of intro outcomes (closed deals, hires made, capital raised)

## Job 3: Portfolio Intelligence & Pattern Recognition
**When** I'm advising a founder on strategy,  
**I want** to access benchmarks and patterns from similar companies in the portfolio,  
**So that** I can give data-informed advice based on what's actually working.

### Success Criteria:
- Comparative analytics across portfolio segments
- Best practice identification (what top performers do differently)
- Anonymized peer benchmarking founders can see
- Trend detection across sectors/stages

## Job 4: Automated Insight Generation
**When** portfolio companies have their regular meetings,  
**I want** to automatically extract key metrics, requests, and action items from meeting transcripts,  
**So that** I never miss critical information and can focus on helping rather than note-taking.

### Success Criteria:
- Auto-ingestion of Firefly/meeting recordings
- Extraction of metrics, asks, sentiment, red/green flags
- Automatic CRM updates with founder interactions
- Monthly report generation per company

# For Founders

## Job 5: Effortless Benefit Discovery & Access
**When** I need help with something specific,  
**I want** to see all relevant Norte resources, perks, and connections in one place,  
**So that** I can access Norte's full value without having to remember or ask what's available.

### Success Criteria:
- Personal portal showing all available benefits/perks (AWS, NVIDIA, Oracle credits, etc.)
- Network directory (potential customers, advisors, investors)
- Request system for intros/help with status tracking
- Resource library (templates, playbooks, best practices)

## Job 6: Transparent Performance Tracking
**When** I want to understand how my company is performing,  
**I want** to see my metrics and compare them anonymously against portfolio benchmarks,  
**So that** I can identify where I'm excelling or falling behind and course-correct.

### Success Criteria:
- Personal dashboard with key metrics (ARR, growth, employee count, churn, runway)
- Anonymous peer comparisons
- Trend visualization over time
- Automated investor update generation
